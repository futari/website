    othing to put here as of yet, really. I want to put some 2D and 3D artstuff that I do here. <br/>

  <div class="intro">I might do some comics here, maybe? It's pretty unlikely. Only time will tell, I suppose.<br/>
  Speaking of which... the Facebook share button only shares the generic Facebook page, as I haven't applied for an app ID yet. <br/>
  I will re-organize things once I have more content to post...
