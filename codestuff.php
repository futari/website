        For my first jQuery widget project, I wanted to see if I can make some circular data representation method. 
        I wanted to try representing a tree in weird, possibly fun ways. This is essentially what came of it. 
        The tree data itself is a Javascript object. The widget is called on an empty div with the class 'tree' and 
        the tree is passed in to create this. I'm still deciding what I want to do with this and it certainly needs
        some polishing - it only displays up to grandchildren nodes of the root node, some mathstuffs are needed
        to be done to fix the text inside the children nodes from rotating, the created product does not fit neatly
        into its container and I still haven't decided how I'm going to add functionality to each node on clicking yet.
        But here it is.
